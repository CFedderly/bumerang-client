# B端merang

B端merang is a real-time borrowing and lending app developed for Android. 
When was the last time you forgot your laptop charger and didn't want to go home
for it? Or maybe you're looking for a study buddy to cram for the final? Then
B端merang is for you. Simply create a request describing what you need and for how long,
then post a request for others to see. Have something you feel the world needs? A guitar
for others to play, or warm-baked cookies you want to share? B端merang also has a lending option!
